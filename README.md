# Domino-s-Sales-Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Data Analytics solution built using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence to optimize operations, understand customer behavior, and improve revenue.
Tech Stack- 
1) Tool: Power BI Desktop
2) Language: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
3) Data Prep: Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
4) Visualization: Power BI Report Designer

Key Insights & Business Questions Answered- 
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance, addressing:
1) Revenue & Growth: Total revenue generation, Average Order Value (AOV), and monthly sales trends.
2) Customer Behavior: Peak ordering hours (Rush Hour analysis) and preferred pizza sizes.
3) Product Performance: Revenue distribution by category (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken) and identifying the Top 5 best-selling pizzas.
4) Temporal Analysis: Seasonality and identifying high/low traffic days of the week.

Key Features-
1) Interactive Filtering: Users can slice data by Day of the Week and Pizza Name to see real-time updates across all visuals.
